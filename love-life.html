    <p>...Alin maybe a sneaky, asshole prick, but my routine of stalking him made me realize something the universe or god has been trying to tell me - IM NOT SUPPOSED TO BE LIKE A DUDE!</p>
    
    <p>It all started when I was a wee girl, I was treated violently and cruelly by my father. He despised my femininity and so he punished it EVERYDAY! Gradually I understood that I would be spared if I acted less and less feminine and more masculine. Doing this female equivalent of male emasculation makes insecure and less-than men feel more secure in their fragile masculinity(until the next trigger comes up).</p>
