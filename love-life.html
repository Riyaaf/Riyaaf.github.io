    <p style="color: #C71585; font-size: 25px;" >Alin : Do you respect yourself?</p>
    <p>...Alin maybe a sneaky, asshole prick, but my routine of stalking him made me realize something the universe or god has been trying to tell me - IM NOT SUPPOSED TO BE LIKE A DUDE!</p>
    
    <p>It all started when I was a wee girl, I was treated violently and cruelly by my father. He despised my femininity and so he punished it EVERYDAY! Gradually I understood that I would be spared if I acted less and less feminine and more masculine. Doing this female equivalent of male emasculation makes insecure and less-than men feel more secure in their fragile masculinity(until the next trigger comes up).</p>
    <p>And then I became a pick-me, where I fake stoicism and nonchalance upon not being treated like a girl, because i wasn't like other girls! I wanted to be validated and given attention and I knew what a my insecure care-taker despised. Oh, but of course, at the same time, he was rewarding the femininity of other girls. This was simply his way of him killing my biology and hence me.</p>
    <p>Then I met this ancap, 16 years older than me and who hated women and femininity. I became his little pet in hopes of being picked. I would make it a point to criticise normal female traits, mainly them being attracted to sweet, romantic gestures, shiny, new gifts, being financially provided for and wanting to show off this physical beauty. This was done to appease Dennis's ego because he was too old, lazy and broke, and average in skills and looks. The mentioned traits in a girl would make him distrustful of her staying with him because he couldn't fulfill her needs.</p>
