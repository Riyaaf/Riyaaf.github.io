       <p>..since abuse & gaslighting is so prevalent, i guess i qualify as a normal girl.</p>

        <p style="color: #003E7F;">For the past 1 year ive missed the non-binary dog i was in Himachal. The burning down of Tandi is bittersweet and romantic in a way. It reminds me of mold *smiling* back at me. Sinister but it's the nature of nature, to cause loss and destruction. I wonder if mold smiles because it's unaware of the inconvenience it causes or if he knows more about the universe than I do. The wisdom of the fungus is humbling.</p>
        <p style="color: #003E7F;"> I always heard the phrase "coming a full-circle" but I'm only experiencing it for the first time. (tbc)</p>
<p>If you came here hoping to see nudes, I'm 98% sure this site won't have them. This is a housewifey venture, because let's face it, I am that age.</p>
        <p>OF happened cuz of a bunch of good reasons, but my cunt ex hadn't clarified his intentions in the relationship, so my motivatiom left the chat. The whole "desi whores" for BWC shtick makes my skin crawl with cringe because Alin wanted to be treated like a superior man so bad. But are Romanians legit whites?</p>
        <p>Welp I guess I experimented. The dynamics quickly turned to shit to the point I wasn't even allowed access to my own social media accounts ugh the regret is real. I paid the price for dating a low IQ/amoral guy.</p>
        <p>He cared fuckall about morality anyway. If you'd been wondering what I've been up to, well my soul is re-entering my body as of now :)</p>
