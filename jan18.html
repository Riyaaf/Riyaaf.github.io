  <p> The snowflakes falling outside my window make me smile with contentment and wonder. Wondering who wouldn't want to spend time with me on such a beautiful day.</p>
  <p>Everyone wants to be popular but they'll do anything to hide the skeletons in their closet, i think of Alin when I speak this.</p>
<p> God i miss the illusion I had of the dream guy when I used to crush on my army dilf. The secret to romance is to create an idea and to keep loving that idea ðŸŒ¸, ideally the idea has a big dick with an age difference. It's your idea so it's a form of self-love and aren't you just so beautiful and petite?</p>
  <p>I miss playing my guitar, thinking of the cool, sauve, fit daddy who would be so proud of his big-titted princess. The validation I get from older men is my life-force. I'm his little fairy until I beget him kids. imma secretly film his hands all over me validating me, his daily login.</p>
